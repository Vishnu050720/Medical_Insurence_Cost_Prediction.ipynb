🩺 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
This project predicts individual medical insurance costs using a Linear Regression model trained on health and demographic features such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.

📘 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to estimate the medical insurance charges based on user data.
A Linear Regression model was implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
🧠 Machine Learning Model
Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
Target Variable: Insurance Charges
Features Used: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region
Dataset Source: Medical Insurance dataset (commonly available on Kaggle)
📈 Model Performance
Metric	Value
R² Score	0.79
(Replace 0.79 with your actual R² value.)

The model explains approximately 79% of the variance in medical charges, showing a good fit for a simple linear model.

🧩 Future Improvements
Try Polynomial Regression or Random Forest Regressor to improve prediction accuracy
Add hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
Include visualizations for feature importance and residual errors
